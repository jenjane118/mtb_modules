had to install wget on laptop first, then download anaconda

```{bash}
brew install wget
wget "https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"

shasum -a256 ~/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.sh | awk '$1=="3980c2a57fde5de2ccfdf0d7973f95ac1a3fa63351642e6735c50fc3791ef0f1"{print"match"}'

# i moved file to downloads folder because that's where it should be!
bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
source /Users/jenniferstiens/anaconda3/bin/activate
conda init zsh

conda install -c r r=3.6
conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-genomicalignments bioconductor-iranges bioconductor-rsamtools bioconductor-rsubread bioconductor-deseq2
conda install -c conda-forge r-devtools
conda install -c r rstudio

# added to ~/.bash_profile so when I open rstudio with alias on command line, it opens correct version of r (but will it have entire env?)
alias rstu3.6="RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/jenniferstiens/anaconda3/envs/r_3.6/bin/R open -a rstudio"
source ~/.bash_profile
#this should open up rstudio in the right r env but I'm not sure it works.
rstu3.6 
# it does open with correct R, but opens with all other project files open. need to change global settings so it doesn't open saved workspace automatically?
```

```{bash}
# to run artemis I found file in anaconda and clicked it, but this came up on terminal

/Users/jenniferstiens/anaconda3/pkgs/artemis-18.1.0-0/share/artemis-18.1.0-0/art ; exit;
# need to add this to my path?
export PATH=${PATH}:~/anaconda3/pkgs/artemis-18.1.0-0/share/artemis-18.1.0-0/art
# and add line to ~/.bash_profile

```


Still trying to get rstudio to work with r_4.0 env on thoth

(base) thoth.cryst.bbk.ac.uk> conda activate r_4.0
(r_4.0) thoth.cryst.bbk.ac.uk> rstudio
```
